Points = (Current Value / Target ) * Weightage of that field

current direct referrals = 10
weightage (admin side) = 20%
normaliztion target = 10

10 / 10 = 1 * 20 = 20 score (direct referrals)

team size = 4000
weightage = 80%
target = 200

(team size / target) * weightage
4000 / 200 = 50
50 * 80 = 4000 score

20 + 4000 = 4020 total score to calculate rank of the user.

(100 / 20) * 20 = 100 Points

1000
+10 = 1010
-20 = 990
+10 = 1000
+30 = 1030

profit sharing = 1030 - 1010 = 20 (high watermark)
